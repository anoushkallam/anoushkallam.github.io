## Hi, I'm Anoushka!

🎓 I go to McMaster University for Automotive and vehicle engineering technology and totally love it!<br/><br/>
❤️ My favourite courses so far are SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Structures and Propterties of Materials, and Thermodynamics.<br/><br/>
💭 My current personal project is a Smart Dog Collar that will track the dog's location, monitor activity levels, and provide integration with a vehicle's system like GPS tracking and alerts.<br/><br/>
